about_content: | 
  Hi, my name's Matthias. Over the past 20 years, I have been developer, architect, release engineer, scrum master, project lead, tech lead and director. 
  
  No matter the role, I love software engineering, smiling customers and winning as a team.
  
  My values are <mark>Openness</mark>, <mark>Knowledge Sharing</mark>, <mark>Teamwork</mark> and <mark>Sustainability</mark>.

  I also value [source code](https://github.com/culmat/cv) over slides. I like to release early and often.
  
  I am fluent in German, English and French.
  
  My current centre of interest is machine learning.
